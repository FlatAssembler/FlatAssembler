- 👋 Hi, I’m Teo Samaržija, known on some social networks as @FlatAssembler.
- 👀 I’m interested primarily in front-end development, low-level development, compiler development, and historical linguistics (particularly the names of places in Croatia, you can read [my paper about applying information theory to the Croatian river names](https://flatassembler.github.io/Karasica.doc) which I published in two journals or [its English-language summary on my blog](https://flatassembler.github.io/toponyms.html#english_summary)).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of difficult and mostly useless things, at the university.
For a piece of paper called diploma, which is supposed to help me get hired, even if I do not know whether it actually does that. I am often feeling stupid because of that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, I haven't yet decided. I am also currently struggling with a mental illness (a psychotic disorder, Risperidone appears to help), so I cannot collaborate on anything right now.
- 📫 You can get to my e-mail address by solving the spambot-protection problem on [my Error 404 page](https://flatassembler.github.io/does_not_exist.html), or on the menu that is opened by clicking the top-left icon on my [web-app that converts arithmetic expressions to x86 assembly](https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler.html), or the link on the bottom of my [PicoBlaze Simulator](https://flatassembler.github.io/PicoBlaze/PicoBlaze), or by clicking *contact me* at the very bottom of [my homepage](https://flatassembler.github.io/).
