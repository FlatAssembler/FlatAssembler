- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Teo Samar≈æija, known on some social networks as @FlatAssembler.
- üëÄ My interests are:
  - Professional interests: front-end development, low-level development, and compiler development (see the pinned repositories for examples of those, or watch my videos about [compiler development](https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler-theory-latin.mp4) or [front-end development](https://flatassembler.github.io/front-end-development.mp4)).
  - Hobby interests: historical linguistics (particularly the names of places in Croatia, you can read [my paper about applying information theory to the Croatian river names](https://flatassembler.github.io/Karasica.doc) which I published in two journals or [its English-language summary on my website](https://flatassembler.github.io/toponyms.html#english_summary), or watch [a video about that paper in Latin](https://flatassembler.github.io/river-names.mp4)). Previously, I was interested in competitive programming. For example, [I won the 4th place on Infokup in 2013](https://informatika.azoo.hr/natjecanje/dogadjaj/235/rezultati).
- üå± <del>I‚Äôm currently learning a lot of difficult and mostly useless things, at the university.
For a piece of paper called diploma, which is supposed to help me get hired, even if I do not know whether it actually does that. I am often feeling stupid because of that.</del> (UPDATE: Now I have graduated with a university Bachelor degree in computer engineering and I am unemployed. I also have a front-end development certificate from the Algebra-Bernays school, thus far to no avail.)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... Well, I haven't yet decided. <del>I am also currently struggling with a mental illness (a psychotic disorder, Risperidone appears to help), so I cannot collaborate on anything right now.</del> (UPDATE: Well, I am collaborating rather successfully right now with [@agustiza](https://github.com/agustiza) and [@abdrd](https://github.com/abdrd) on [my PicoBlaze assembler and emulator](https://github.com/FlatAssembler/PicoBlaze_Simulator_in_JS.git). I am still taking Risperidone, and probably will for the rest of my life.)
- üì´ You can get to my e-mail address by solving the spambot-protection problem on [my Error 404 page](https://flatassembler.github.io/does_not_exist.html), or on the menu that is opened by clicking the top-left icon on my [web-app that converts arithmetic expressions to x86 assembly](https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler.html), or the link on the bottom of my [PicoBlaze assembler and emulator](https://flatassembler.github.io/PicoBlaze/PicoBlaze), or by clicking *contact me* at the very bottom of [my homepage](https://flatassembler.github.io/).
